Stellar is a program made with `python`, `bash` and `nodejs` to improve the boring appearance of `termux` by giving it a new look and adding new functionalities.

Although it includes some hacking and OSINT-oriented tools in the form of commands, it focuses on improving termux's appearance by providing customization layers.

<summary><b>🔨 Plugins</b></summary>

How to use? You can create your own commands for Stellar in any programming language. When starting Stellar, it will automatically load each command/plugin you have created for use.

How do I create a plugin? You can make a plugin for anything. In the following path >>> Stellar/plugins you cd or use your favorite tool to go to the path and place your plugin. After that, restart your terminal and Stellar will load it. You can do it in Bash, Python or JavaScript since these are the languages that Stellar installs by default and you won't have to install anything at the last moment, although of course you can also create in the language you want by installing the compiler of your favorite programming language.
